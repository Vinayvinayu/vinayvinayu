- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building an application in Azure platform with Springboot on Azure AKS, Docker, Angular with hosting on Blob Storage with Azure AD authentication.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently gaining more expertise/ proficiency on Python with Machine learning and Big data.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on React based web apps.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Cloud Migration, Enterprise Architecture, Cloud based web applications with Java.

- âš¡ I mostly keep updated with new technologies and I recently started pushing my POCs to Github.

<b>Non Functional Requirement</b></br>
A non-functional requirement defines the quality attribute of a software system.
It is not mandatory.
Applied to a system as a whole.

Usability requirement
Serviceability requirement
Manageability requirement
Recoverability requirement
Security requirement
Data Integrity requirement
Capacity requirement
Availability requirement
Scalability requirement
Interoperability requirement
Reliability requirement
Maintainability requirement
Regulatory requirement
Environmental requirement<\br>
Portability
Reliability
Performance
Reusability
Flexibility

<b>examples of NFRs:</b>
availability, scalability, reliability
Audit trails
Logging requirements , zipkin
response time
number of simultaneous users supported
portability between onpremise & multi cloud?
Non-Functional Testing like Performance, Stress, Usability, Security testing, etc.

### Design patterns for new applications:
  - External Configuration : externalizing credentials using Azure Vault or Hashicorp Vault etc.
  - Cache Aside : This is a standard Caching pattern where we cache most frequently used read only data.
  - Federated Identity : oauth2 using Azure AD, siteminder etc.
  - Valet Key : This is similar to providing a token by Azure Blob or AWS S3 for temporary time/ used based access.
  - Gatekeeper : Example Web Application Firewall in AWS.
  - Circuit Breaker: In a micro service environment when one of the service is not working the micro service will open the circuit and a gracefull error message/ valid values is sent back to the calling service.
  - Retry : retry when some external service fails transiently.
  - Strangler : incrementally migrate a legacy system, gradually replace functionality of application.
  
### Resiliency and Availability Patterns in cloud:
  - Availability Patterns
  - Data Management Patterns
  - Design and Implementation patterns
  - Performance and Scalability Patterns
  - Resilience patterns
